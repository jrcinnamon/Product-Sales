#Product Sales Analysis

In this project, I use Python with various libraries (including Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib) to determine the best sales method for a company's
new product line. My work can be found [here](https://github.com/jrcinnamon/Product-Sales/blob/main/product_sales_answers.ipynb)
